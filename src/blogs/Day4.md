Roughly 800 sakura trees line the banks along the Meguro River Take your time and enjoy the river walk, or find a nice spot to stop and have a picnic. Picnicking beneath the cherry blossoms has been a staple of Japanese tradition for centuries.

Nakameguro turns the lights on after dark. The trees are illuminated and festive food and drinks are on sale along the river. Night viewing adds a different dimension to traditional cherry blossom viewing.
